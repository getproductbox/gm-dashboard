# GM Admin - Product Requirements Document

## TL;DR
Develop a dedicated staff management platform for GM's venue operations, starting with Manor's karaoke and venue hire services, then expanding to support multiple venues (including Hippie Club). This admin-only application targets venue managers and staff seeking efficient booking management, operational automation, and data-driven insights.

## Application Scope

### Admin-Only Platform
This application is exclusively designed for **staff and venue managers**. Customer-facing booking flows are handled by a separate customer application to ensure:

- **Focused User Experience**: Optimized specifically for staff workflows and operational needs
- **Security Separation**: Admin functions isolated from customer interfaces
- **Independent Scaling**: Admin and customer systems can be deployed and scaled independently
- **Simplified Maintenance**: Codebase focused solely on management features and staff productivity

## Goals

- **Centralized Operations**: Provide a single dashboard for all venue management activities
- **Automate Administrative Functions**: Free up staff from data entry, analysis, and manual processes so they can focus on customer experience and strategic initiatives
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Deliver analytics and insights for informed operational decisions
- **Multi-Venue Scalability**: Support expansion from Manor to multiple venues
- **Ultimate Goal**: 80% reduction in time spent on booking administration tasks

## Success Metrics

- **Stage 1**: 100% of Manor venue hire bookings processed through the admin platform
- **Stage 3**: 100% of all bookings across all venues managed through the platform
- **Ultimate**: Staff spending 80% less time on administrative booking tasks, redirecting effort to customer experience and strategic initiatives

## Non-Goals

- Customer-facing booking interfaces (handled by separate customer application)
- Advanced AI-powered pricing optimization or demand forecasting
- Complex inventory management for food, beverages, or merchandise
- Integration with accounting software or payroll systems
- Advanced staff scheduling and payroll management features
